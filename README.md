Inspiration
The Indian govt. has taken up the challenge of solving problems in Rural India like Agriculture, Education and Healthcare. But the highly skilled artspeople and craftsmen i.e. ARTISANS are ignored when it comes to aid from the government.

India has a very diverse and unique handicrafts culture that is slowly fading away due to 2 reasons

Lack of discoverability for artisans (to sell their products)
Lack of consumer awareness (People just don't know about the beauty these artisans create!)
We aim to solve this issue through our 2 sided marketplace and artisan awareness app - Artisell.

What it does
Simply, there are 2 apps involved in Artisell. The seller app and the buyer app. The seller app is meant for Artisans, and has a UNIQUE, SIMPLE, and INTUITIVE user experience catered to users who are laymen and have little or no knowledge of using smartphones. The USP of the seller app is that in just a few simple steps and careful guidance, the Artisan can sell his products online. Apart from this, the seller app has following features (All built with usability in mind)

Add product (4 steps -> Select category, Type or Say product name, Upload image, and Add Price)

Here automatically our system generates tags based on the image uploaded
For every step there is visual cues and the artisan can press a button to HEAR a voice clip explaining what to do
Incase there is no internet the product is stored offline and sent to server later
Accept Job offers

Any user/buyer can push job requests through the seller app. These can be viewed, reviewed and accepted by artisans
